  "description": "Write into a remote file.\nThe server shall place the contents of the field 'data' into the file pointed by 'path' at the offset specified by\nthe field 'offset'.\nWhen writing a file, the client should repeatedly call this service with data while advancing offset until the file\nis written completely. When write is complete, the client shall call the service one last time, with the offset\nset to the size of the file and with the data field empty, which will signal the server that the write operation is\ncomplete.\nWhen the write operation is complete, the server shall truncate the resulting file past the specified offset.\nServer implementation advice:\nIt is recommended to implement proper handling of concurrent writes to the same file from different clients, for\nexample by means of creating a staging area for uncompleted writes (like FTP servers do).",
