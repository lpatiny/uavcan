This condition allows other servers to quickly re-discover the cluster\nafter restart.\nThis message should be broadcasted by the server at this interval until all other servers are discovered.\nNumber of servers in the cluster as configured on the sender.\nNode ID of servers that are known to the publishing server, including the publishing server itself.\nCapacity of this array defines maximum size of the server cluster.",
