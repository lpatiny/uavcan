  "description": "Nested type.\nGeneric software version information.\nPrimary version numbers.\nIf both fields are set to zero, the version is considered unknown.\nThis mask indicates which optional fields (see below) are set.\nVCS commit hash or revision number, e.g. git short commit hash. Optional.\nThe value of an arbitrary hash function applied to the firmware image.\nThis field is used to detect whether the firmware running on the node is EXACTLY THE SAME\nas a certain specific revision. This field provides the absolute identity guarantee, unlike\nthe version fields above, which can be the same for different builds of the firmware.\nThe exact hash function and the methods of its application are implementation defined.\nHowever, implementations are recommended to adhere to the following guidelines,\nfully or partially:\n  - The hash function should be CRC-64-WE, the same that is used for computing DSDL signatures.\n  - The hash function should be applied to the entire application image padded to 8 bytes.\n  - If the computed image CRC is stored within the firmware image itself, the value of\n    the hash function becomes ill-defined, because it becomes recursively dependent on itself.\n    In order to circumvent this issue, while computing or checking the CRC, its value stored\n    within the image should be zeroed out.",
